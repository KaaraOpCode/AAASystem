AAA System (Authentication, Authorization, Access Control)
Overview

The AAA System is designed to manage user authentication, authorization, and access control in a secure and structured manner. The system integrates various components to ensure that users are properly authenticated, authorized, and granted access to resources based on predefined roles and permissions.

Components
Authentication: Validates user credentials and confirms the identity of the user.
Authorization: Determines whether a user has the necessary permissions to perform a specific action.
Access Control: Manages the permissions to access specific resources based on user roles.
System Architecture
1. Authentication
The Authentication class is responsible for verifying user credentials. It checks if the user ID exists and whether the provided credentials match the stored information.

2. Authorization
The Authorization class handles the process of determining if a user is authorized to perform a specific action. It uses user roles and predefined permissions to validate actions.

3. Access Control
The AccessControl class controls access to resources based on the user's role. It ensures that users are granted or denied access to resources appropriately.

4. SysLogger
The SysLogger class is used to log authentication, authorization, and access events. It records events with varying levels of severity (e.g., INFO, ERROR, ALERT).

5. AAAAnalyzer
The AAAAnalyzer class processes events, handles failed attempts, and proposes countermeasures. It integrates with SysLogger to log analysis and countermeasures.

6. DictDatabase
The DictDatabase class serves as a mock database, storing user roles, logging events, and managing failed attempts, known IPs, and MAC addresses.
